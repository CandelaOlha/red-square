# Red Square

## About this project

This is a project I chose from [frontendpractice.com](https://www.frontendpractice.com/) in order to improve and test my skills as a software developer.

By recreating this website I learned about minimal design, scroll animations and hover effects.

Also, even though it was not included in the original project, I added a dark mode switch to give the user more control over the interface layout.

Furthermore, I took advantage of local storage to save user color preferences so that the next time the page loads, the screen is displayed in the previously selected mode.
